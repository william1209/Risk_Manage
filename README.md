## Background Investigation -- Expected patterns
For most case we need to know as certain as possible when market volatiles and when it doesn't. Thus we pry into the VIX index that reflects fluctuations more than anyelse.  

### Clustering 
* Since it's almost a stationary series, it may have specific behaviour in specific duration. Applying cluster algorithm enable us to have a better knowledge estimating how volatile the current market is, comparing to history data.
* After clustering, we count how many crash times each cluster has. Then reckon it as a safezone or dangerzone
