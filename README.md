## Background Investigation -- Expected patterns
For most winning cases, having a knowledge when market volatiles or not is a must. Thus we pry into the VIX index which reflects fluctuations more than anyelse. By applying cluster algorithm, we may have a glimpse at the silhouette of the market true nature, but yet enough. To solve this, classification algorithm/method yields a very good solution. Also the process is the so-called "Unsupervised Classification"

* Cluster -- EM-GMM model
* Classification -- Random Forrest

## Anomalies within background intervals -- Unexpected patterns
The max amplitude of fluctuations is limited in each cluster, theoretically. As a matter of fact, it does refresh records. To say there are 2 categories of this series... up-trend and down-trend, anomalies are something between, which are unable to be classified.
